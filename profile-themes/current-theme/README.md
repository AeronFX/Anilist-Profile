<h2>**Foreword**<h2>

<p>I haven't named this yet, since I only have one profile CSS style so far, but this is technically version 1.1,
since I made a couple of major changes in the last couple of days after it went live.

Special thanks to Bluetaku (https://anilist.co/user/Bluetaku) and Sleepy (https://anilist.co/user/sleepy) for putting up
with my incessant questions about CSS, and to Anzu (https://anilist.co/user/Anzu) for being so generous as to have your own
CSS public, which helped me particularly with variable syntax at the end.

If you're using this as a basis for your own profile and you have a question about any of it, feel free to drop me a message
on Anilist or Discord and I'll help you to the best of my ability.</p>
